The last day of the disco| It's the end, the very last morning The very last jasmine Don't let go of my hand It's the end, the distant sun Flows alone in his corner Don't let go i hold you | The last day of the disco I want to pass it on your skin To blush like a poppy The last day of the disco I want to hear it in stereo And tell you that there is nothing more beautiful | This is the end, the bronze statues Sink in their sorrow Don't let go of my hand, this is the end The rivers of fate run wild like satin Don't let go, I got you | It's the end, the colors suddenly Read the explanation Merge with charcoal Don't let go, it's okay It's the end, I see in the drawing Something divine Your maze, my garden
